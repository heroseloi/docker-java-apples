# docker-java-apples
A lightweight Docker container with XFCE, VNC, Firefox 52 ESR, and Java plugin support for running legacy Java applets.

This project provides a ready-to-use Docker container based on Ubuntu 18.04 with a lightweight XFCE desktop environment accessible via VNC. It includes Firefox 52 ESR—one of the last versions supporting NPAPI plugins—alongside Java 8 and the necessary plugin integration to enable legacy Java applet support. Designed for testing and accessing older web applications that depend on Java applets, this container offers a convenient, isolated environment that runs independently of the host system’s browser or Java configuration.
